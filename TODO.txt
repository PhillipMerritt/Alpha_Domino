- if everyone passes redraw the hand

- changing points in game to list of points

- dealing with revealed dominoes still in opponents hand

- ending hands early if the team that won the bid can't get enough points

Temporary Fixes:
    - ***** had to force the first player to bid or else the untrained agents chose to pass forever *****
    - ***** had to remove the option to not choose a trump suit temporarily *****
    - ***** follow me suit can't be doubles *****

Fix Later:
    - Should players be able to not bid at all?

hardcoded things to fix:

    - commit_stmemory in memory.py
    - "teams" like in Texas42 in memory section of playmatches in funcs.py
    - tourney set up in run.py
    - action_space and action_size in game.py
    - directions in backfill() in MCTS.py
